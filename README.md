-- Vectorizor --

A simple app that will allow creating simple vector drawings and animations. I created this tool to assist with video animations.

    Started work on this yesterday, but planning to work on it for another three hours at most today. Should be possible to finish it in that time. 

    Basically the app will immitate a retro style of vector drawing that I'm imagining may have existed, similar to tennis for two. It has a single point that it has to move to draw out lines and create shapes. This app will be a tool to create these animations.

    The app can already save coordinates from clicked positions and redraw the same thing. Now it just needs to animate that.

    Some shit came up that made me not particularly want to work on this for a few days. Back to the grind.

    The bitch can now draw one line from start to finish without overflowing or underflowing.

    Good strides yesterday, gonna try to do about 3 hours of work today. As I said yesterday, hopefully today will be the last day.

    Got a lot of shit done today. But I'm hungry and it sure as shit ain't done. Gonna get back to this later.

    Obviously didn't finish yesterday lol. Gonna stop being hopeful and just put some work in.

    I think I'm caught up organizing the code somewhat and fixing bugs. Time to add features.

    Having issues getting the animation to play nice with moved lines without breaking the line dash offset. Tomorrow I guess.

--To-Do--

-Add a simple option to wiggle lines like all wavey like, or possibly in the style of animations where the lines are scribbly and swap between two renditions of the same frame
