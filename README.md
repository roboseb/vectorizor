-- Vectorizor --

A simple app that will allow creating simple vector drawings and animations. I created this tool to assist with video animations.

    Started work on this yesterday, but planning to work on it for another three hours at most today. Should be possible to finish it in that time. 

    Basically the app will immitate a retro style of vector drawing that I'm imagining may have existed, similar to tennis for two. It has a single point that it has to move to draw out lines and create shapes. This app will be a tool to create these animations.

    The app can already save coordinates from clicked positions and redraw the same thing. Now it just needs to animate that.
